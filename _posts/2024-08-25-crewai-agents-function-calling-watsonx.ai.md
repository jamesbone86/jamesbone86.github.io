*LLM Agents and Function Calling are powerful techniques to build modern AI applications. This post describes a sample how to use multiple crewAI agents, custom Python functions and LLM models on watsonx.ai.*

Definition of agents from crewAI:

> An agent is an autonomous unit programmed to: Perform tasks; Make decisions; Communicate with other agents. Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.

## Example Scenario

In the following example scenario users can ask the AI application to write a keynote about a certain topic. Watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUrENDkPw_k) for a great demo.

To implement this scenario, two agents are used which leverage Mixtral  and Llama running on watsonx.ai and a Python function which runs internet searches.

## Code

The code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nicknochnack/WatsonxCrewAI). I've changed the part where Google searches are run via a third party provider.

```python
from crewai import Crew, Task, Agent
from langchain_ibm import WatsonxLLM
import os
from langchain.tools import tool
os.environ["WATSONX_APIKEY"] = "xxx"

llm = WatsonxLLM(
    model_id="meta-llama/llama-3-70b-instruct",
    url="https://eu-de.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    params={"decoding_method": "greedy", "max_new_tokens": 500},
    project_id="xxx",
)
function_calling_llm = WatsonxLLM(
    model_id="mistralai/mixtral-8x7b-instruct-v01",
    url="https://eu-de.ml.cloud.ibm.com",
    params=parameters,
    project_id="xxx",
)

@tool("Search in Internet")
def search(topic: str) -> str:
     """search service provides live searches in the internet for a specific topic.
     Args:
        topic: The parameter topic is a string e.g. 'Quantum'.
     """
     
     result = """Title: Research | IBM Quantum Computing
Link: https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing
Snippet: Quantum computing is an emergent field of cutting-edge computer science harnessing the unique qualities of quantum mechanics to solve problems beyond the ability of even the most powerful classical computers.

     return result
     
researcher = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    function_calling_llm=function_calling_llm,
    role="Senior AI Researcher",
    goal="Find promising research in the field of quantum computing.",
    backstory="You are a veteran quantum computing researcher with a background in modern physics.",
    tools=[search]
)
task1 = Task(
    description="Search the internet and find one example of promising AI research from IBM.",
    expected_output="A short summary of the topic.",
    agent=researcher
)

writer = Agent(
    llm=llm,
    role="Senior Speech Writer",
    goal="Write engaging and witty keynote speeches from provided research.",
    backstory="You are a veteran quantum computing writer with a background in modern physics."
)
task2 = Task(
    description="Write an engaging keynote speech on quantum computing.",
    expected_output="A detailed keynote speech with an intro, body and conclusion.",
    agent=writer
)

crew = Crew(agents=[researcher, writer], tasks=[task1, task2], verbose=True, output_log_file=True, share_crew=False)
print(crew.kickoff())
```

## Execution Flow

Here is what happens when you run the code:

* The researcher agent runs the first search to find relevant information via the Python search function
* The researcher agent determines whether it has enough information. If not, it runs more specific queries.
* Once the researcher agent has enough information, it provides a final answer to the AI application.
* Next the writer agent invokes a LLM model to generate the keynote by passing in the results of the researcher agent.
