*LLM Agents and Function Calling are powerful techniques to build modern AI applications. IBM Research open sourced the Bee Agent Framework. This post describes how with this framework agents can generate Python code via LLMs and how this code can be executed in containers.*

IBM Research has open sourced a new agent framework, called [Bee Agent Framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework).

> Open-source framework for building, deploying, and serving powerful agentic workflows at scale. The Bee framework makes it easy to build agentic workflows with leading proprietary and open-source models. Weâ€™re working on bringing model-agnostic support to any LLM to help developers avoid model provider lock-in and embrace the latest open-source LLMs.

Read my post [Simple Bee Agent Framework Example]({{ "/article/bee-agents-function-calling-watsonx.ai/" | relative_url }}) for an introduction.

## Evolution of AI Systems

Single ```Large Language Models``` provide great capabilities, but when only prompted directly with user input, they can only return what they knew at the time of the pre-training.

Prompt engineering, few shot learning, chain of thought and other techniques improve results compared to raw user input only prompts. With RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) models can even handle information which was not known at training time.

Agents are the next step in the evolution of AI systems. Multiple specialized LLMs can work together. Additionally, they can even invoke tools to execute predefined code.

This post shows how LLMs can even generate code dynamically which is executed in containers. Personally, I think this is amazing!

## Overview

The example below is very simple but demonstrates how a language model can generate Python code which is executed in a container running with Podman. The LLM generates code to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

For security reasons the generated code is run in container sandboxes. This is important to ensure the code doesn't damage the overall AI application and the machine it is running on.

## Code

Here is the complete source code. Note the part where the agent is defined with the 'PythonTool'.

## Start Containers

There is a script to start the two containers. Either Docker or Podman is required with compose.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework
corepack yarn install
# start Podman or Docker
corepack yarn run infra:start-code-interpreter
# get the port and define it in .env
```

The [source code](https://github.com/i-am-bee/bee-agent-framework/blob/9cff03219f100d7b633c715095abe625e1c84944/src/tools/python/python.ts#L44-L48) describes how Python code should be implemented/generated:

* Run Python code and return the console output. Use for tasks that involve calculations, computations, or data manipulation.
* If files are created inside Python code, the user won't see them right away -- tool output will provide hashes of the created files, and the assistant must reference them using a Markdown link or image, by using the provided URN.
* To work with some files, you must specify them in the input schema; otherwise, the file will not be accessible.
* It is necessary to always print() results. Available libraries include numpy, pandas, scipy, matplotlib (but you have to save the plot as a file, showing does not work), but you can import any library and it will be installed for you.
* The execution state is not preserved -- each invocation is a new environment. Do not use this tool multiple times in a row, always write the full code you want to run in a single invocation.
